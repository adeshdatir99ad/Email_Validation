# Email_validation
Email validation is a process that verifies if an email address is valid or not. This procedure will catch if there are any typos or other mistakes which might result in misdirects and bounces. Email validation will also confirm whether the email exists with a valid domain or not such as Google or Yahoo. 
This project can be used to validate emails using the emailvalidation api
